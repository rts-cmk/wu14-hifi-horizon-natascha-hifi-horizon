                <p>Please check the condition of all products delivered as soon as they are received. This does not affect your statutory rights. If there is a problem we would like to deal with this as soon as possible to alleviate any inconvenience to yourself.</p>
                <p>As soon as we have delivered the goods to you, you will be responsible for them and any damage occasioned whilst in your possession. The majority of goods we send will require you to sign for them upon delivery. If you are not able to sign for a delivery, we will do our utmost to contact you to arrange when it is convenient to redeliver. Our responsibility for everything other than damage due to our negligence will end at the time the carrier tried to delivery the goods to you. If your product is visibly damaged in transit, please sign for the delivery as ‘damaged’ and let us know as soon as possible.</p>
